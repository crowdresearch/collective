# How to Crowd Research Governance
## Getting started
1. If you don’t already have a Github account, create one.
2. Navigate to [Daemo issues](https://github.com/crowdresearch/collective/issues) to review open proposals.

## Submit a proposal
1. Check if there are any existing proposals about the topic you’re proposing by reading the [postings here](https://github.com/crowdresearch/collective/issues).
2. Click New issue on the issues page or navigate directly to the [new issue page](https://github.com/crowdresearch/collective/issues/new).
3. Fill out the template, following its instructions.
4. When complete, click Submit new issue in the bottom right.

## Supporting a proposal
**If you want to work on a proposal**, click the smiley face icon at the top, right of the proposal and select the hooray emoji (the one with confetti). This will record that you are interested in working on this proposal if it passes consensus.

**If you are interested in helping to refine a proposal**, comment in the box at the bottom of the proposal page.

**If you only want to express support for a proposal**, add a comment: `I will help.`

## Breaking consensus on a proposal
1. Copy and paste the [template text](https://github.com/crowdresearch/collective/blob/master/breaking_consensus) into the comment box at the bottom of the proposal page.
2. Follow the directions in the template.

**Note:** You can’t break consensus without filling out this template.

## Reestablishing consensus on a proposal
1. Click on the date information next to your username on your consensus breaking comment.
2. Copy the URL in the browser window. This URL will link directly to your comment.
3. Make a new comment at the bottom of the proposal using [this template](https://github.com/crowdresearch/collective/blob/master/resolving_broken_consensus).
4. Follow the directions in the template.

## Completing a proposal
Once all the parts of the proposal have been completed:
1. If your proposal involves committing a change to the daemo repository, submit a pull request.
2. If your proposal does not involve committing,, mention the relevant review team in a comment at the bottom of the proposal, asking for a review.

## Special proposals
### Strategic planning
To indicate that a proposal is to be treated as part of the strategic planning process,

### Group membership
In order to propose a new member for one of the operational or quality review groups create a proposal containing a paragraph describing the qualifications of the member you are nominating. Mention the member by their github handle (e.g. @markwhiting) in the text and in the title of the proposal.

## Running the system
1. At the start of each weekly meeting, proposals that are open and added before the last 2 days will be selected using a custom search. E.g. [for a meeting on December 6th 2017](https://github.com/crowdresearch/collective/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+created%3A%3C2017-12-04+).
2. Any proposals previously labeled as **in-progress** will be reviewed for completion or updates
3. Any proposals previously labeled as **needs: consensus** will be reviewed
4. If consensus has been resolved the **needs: consensus** label will be removed
5. If the proposal author has responded to the consensus break in the last week, the label will remain.
6. If the proposal author has responded to the consensus break before the last meeting with no updates from the consensus breaking commenter, the break will be assumed void
7. If no changes have occurred since the previous meeting a vote will be added to Slack to determine if the proposal should move forward or not
8. Any proposals without a consensus breaking comment are now accepted.
9. Anyone who has given thumbs up (indicated support) for a proposal should be added as an assignee to the proposal.
10. The proposal will receive the label **in-progress**.
11. Any proposal with a consensus breaking comment will be discussed.
12. If they achieve consensus during the meeting, i.e. if any consensus breaking comments are removed. Follow the instructions for activating the
13. If they do not achieve consensus during the meeting add the label **needs:consensus**
