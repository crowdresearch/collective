# Operational Guide: Stanford Crowd Research Collective
## High-level goals
Generally, the Crowd Research Collective makes decisions through its [regular weekly consensus meeting or quarterly strategic review](https://github.com/crowdresearch/collective/blob/master/governance/process.md). However, this operational guide specifies specific cases where a consensus has been established and action can be taken immediately.
## Operational group membership
Each of the behaviors below can be taken without requiring a proposal or consensus from the rest of the group, as part of regular operational duties. These privileges are assigned to members who have demonstrated ability and responsibility to do so. To gain these privileges, the person must be nominated by a member of the Collective including a paragraph describing the individual's qualifications, and then a one-week vote in a proposal is open to all members of the collective. If the individual is not performing their duties appropriately i.e. acting in bad faith, these privileges may be revoked through a vote in the weekly proposal process, open to all members of the Collective. Being inactive is not considered grounds for removal.

## Categories of operational behaviors
This section describes the behaviors that each operational group can take.
### Responding to inquiries from requesters and workers
Workers, requesters, and others send inquiries to us through the forum and our email address [support@daemo.org](mailto:support@daemo.org). Operational group members can respond to these inquiries, including:

- Requests to join the system
- Help understanding how to use the system
- Help explaining the system's existing policies and operation (e.g., how does Boomerang work?, When do payments arrive?)
- Advice on how to author or complete tasks more effectively

If the request was sent via email, replies should be sent on behalf of "Daemo Team" and should cc support@daemo.org. If the request was made on the forum, replies should be made as individual members with an "admin" flag on forum.daemo.org.
### Fixing bugs
If there is a live bug on the site, or the live site is otherwise not matching the Collective's intention as decided through the proposal process, Pull Requests (PRs) fixing the issue can be immediately merged and deployed by anyone with commit access to the repository. Likewise, if the site is down, this group can act to bring it back up.

### Slack admin
The slack administrator group has admin rights over our group Slack instance. They are able to add and remove members, approve new apps, and perform any relevant cleanup duty. They also ensure that we pay Slack on time.

## Adding new categories of operational behaviors
A proposal through the [usual proposal process](https://github.com/crowdresearch/collective/blob/master/governance/process.md) can add a new category of operational behavior. For example, a proposal might be "Create a category of operational behavior for responding to media inquiries".
## Quality review groups
Quality review as detailed [in our governance document](https://github.com/crowdresearch/collective/blob/master/governance/process.md) requires final quality review from elected teams for specific domains. Membership in these teams is determined [through the same method described for operational group teams](https://github.com/crowdresearch/collective/blob/master/governance/process.md).

## Revising this document
All governing documents can be revised through a proposal in the [usual process](https://github.com/crowdresearch/collective/blob/master/governance/process.md).
